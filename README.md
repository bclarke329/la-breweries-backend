# Louisiana Brewery API 

This is the backend repository for my React project, for Flatiron's phase 5 module. This API contains information on local Louisiana Craft Breweries. This API was created with Ruby On Rails using the --api shortcut. 

## Starting Application 

The Rails server must be started prior to starting the frontend server. 
To do this, 
-run "rails s" in your terminal and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/breweries"

Here you'll be able to see all of the breweries located in Louisiana. Data contains name, address, city, and parish. 

Once server is started, fork and clone frontend repository "https://github.com/bclarke329/la-breweries-front"

Once the frontend repo has been forked and cloned, run "npm start" in your terminal and enjoy!
